# What is the temperature? 8
# Fahrenheit or Celsius (F/C)? F
# At temperature 8.0F, and wind speed 5 mph, the windchill is: -1.11F
# At temperature 8.0F, and wind speed 10 mph, the windchill is: -6.02F
# At temperature 8.0F, and wind speed 15 mph, the windchill is: -9.15F
# At temperature 8.0F, and wind speed 20 mph, the windchill is: -11.50F
# At temperature 8.0F, and wind speed 25 mph, the windchill is: -13.40F
# At temperature 8.0F, and wind speed 30 mph, the windchill is: -15.00F
# At temperature 8.0F, and wind speed 35 mph, the windchill is: -16.39F
# At temperature 8.0F, and wind speed 40 mph, the windchill is: -17.62F
# At temperature 8.0F, and wind speed 45 mph, the windchill is: -18.73F
# At temperature 8.0F, and wind speed 50 mph, the windchill is: -19.74F
# At temperature 8.0F, and wind speed 55 mph, the windchill is: -20.67F
# At temperature 8.0F, and wind speed 60 mph, the windchill is: -21.53F

# Wind Chill (ÂºF) = 35.74 + 0.6215T - 35.75(V0.16) + 0.4275T(V0.16)
